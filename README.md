startpage
=========

My personal startpage. It's a little messy, but who knows if the code is useful.

This currently does three things:

   * Hosts a ton of random links for me to click on
   * Interfaces with my personal wiki
   * Interfaces with trello for my homework

## How to get started
Sooner or later i'll write this.

tl;dr:

    * Setup crontab located in bin/crontab.txt
    * Edit public_html/index.php with your links
    * Edit public_html/template.php with your config
